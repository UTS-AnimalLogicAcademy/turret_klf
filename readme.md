# turret_klf

This library, **turret_klf**, allows us to automatically assign Katana look files to USD assets. We embed a turret query on each USD model when published which resolves to the associated Katana look file.

This is one of the projects which uses **turret_lib**, the other being **turref_usd** (Universal Scene Description).  

## Building

We primarily support building with [rez](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez) on Linux. However we do have prelimary support for windows and non-rez build systems.

For more information check out our other **turret** repos.

## Contributing
We use turret across almost every aspect of our USD pipeline and are constantly fixing bugs and finding time to improve turret more and more. We are however, very open to external pull-requests, and growing turret into a more versatile and robust piece of software with your help. Feel free to get in contact directly or through these GitHub repos. We'd love to talk!
